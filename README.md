### Salut ðŸ‘‹

I study social sciences at a non-social science university with a focus on quantitative methods. Along the way, I work on surveys a lot, mainly around environmental issues and austerity measures. My go-to programming language is R, but I am also familiar with Python and MySQL.

Unfortunately, coding or programming, in general, is still uncharted territory for many social scientists. I want to change this and therefore created a two-day boot camp to make it easier for incoming students to get started in R. All materials are available [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/rbootcamp_2021).

Since I work a lot with survey data and some tasks are pretty repetitive, I wrote a package to simplify the process as much as possible. You can find it [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/sep). And if you are interested in setting up conjoint analyses in Qualtrics, this guide [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/conjoint_excel) can help you.

Every now and then, I try my hand at data visualisations as part of the #TidyTuesday initiative. My tiny portfolio can be found [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/TidyTuesday/tree/master/plots).
