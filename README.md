### Salut ðŸ‘‹

I work as a Data Officer for [REACH](https://www.reach-initiative.org), a think-and-do tank that provides data and analysis on contexts of crisis to inform humanitarian action. Previously, I studied social sciences at a non-social science university with a focus on quantitative methods. In my day-to-day job, I mainly use R, but I am also familiar with Python and MySQL.

Unfortunately, coding or programming, in general, is still uncharted territory for many social scientists. Therefore, I created a two-day boot camp to make it easier for incoming students to get started in R. All materials are available [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/rbootcamp_2021).

For my previous job, I worked a lot with survey data. To simplify parts of the analysis and reporting, I wrote an R package. You can find it [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/sep). And if you are interested in setting up conjoint analyses in Qualtrics, this guide [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/conjoint_excel) can help you.

Every now and then, I try my hand at data visualisations as part of the #TidyTuesday initiative. My tiny portfolio can be found [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/TidyTuesday/tree/master/plots).
