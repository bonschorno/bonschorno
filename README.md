### Salut 👋

I work as a Data Steward for the [Global Health Engineering Group](https://ghe.ethz.ch/), an interdisciplinary group at ETH Zürich researching the drivers for urban services that affect health in over-exploited countries. Previously, I worked as a Data Officer for [REACH](https://www.impact-initiatives.org/what-we-do/reach/), a think-and-do tank that provides data and analysis on contexts of crisis to inform humanitarian action.

Unfortunately, coding or programming in general is still uncharted territory for many social scientists. Therefore, I created a two-day boot camp to make it easier for incoming students to get started in R. All materials are available [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/rbootcamp_2021).

I've worked a lot with survey data. To simplify parts of the analysis and reporting, I wrote an R package. You can find it [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/sep). And if you are interested in setting up conjoint analyses in Qualtrics, this guide [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/conjoint_excel) can help you.

Every now and then, I try my hand at data visualisations as part of the #TidyTuesday initiative. My tiny portfolio can be found [here](https://github.com/bonschorno/TidyTuesday/tree/master/plots).
